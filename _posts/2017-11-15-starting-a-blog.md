Will likely be discussing recent progress on projects and perhaps some ramblings on things I enjoy!

Lately I've been working on a couple of projects. 
The most recent has been my game demo for #ProcJam, which I will be making a separate post on. Super excited to share the details on that!

In addition, I have been juggling between my Major Qualifying Project (Senior Capstone) at WPI, as well as some UI rework on Heist Night.
Both of which I hope to also share progress on in the very near future!
